In my first BBYO event I ended up meeting a great group of friends which was something that I needed at that time period. With a lot of stress in school and my social life another friend group was something that I needed when I joined bbyo I ended up meeting people that I am still friends with today. I believe that the reason that BBYO was such an important thing for me is because it became a pation for me. Each region in the state has a set of chapters(groups) that they need to run. Our chapter has many positions and to this day I am still a position. I am in charge of recruiting members and this is something that is both fun and challening.

Recruiting members is both difficult and fun and without every going to my first event I wouldnt be able to experience the great memories that I made at bbyo. What really happened during this first event was not really about what we did but instead the opperunities it opened up for me. I was able to make friendships and make leadership skills. These things are both good and without going to this event it would not have been possible. I also started working on a website for the youthgroup and so far it has been great. Luckily I have taken webdesign so it will be much easier.
